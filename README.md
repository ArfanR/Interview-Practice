Practice interviewing problems with data structures and algorithms.

Strings    

1. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.  
2. Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.  
3. URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20': You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 
4. Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
