Practice interviewing problems with data structures and algorithms.

Strings    

1. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.  
2. Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.  
3. URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%2e: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
